        <h3 class="title">My coding journey</h3>
        <p>
            I have always known as 'the curious one' - always onto something, observing, exploring (and causing troubles at times). Fine art seemed to be a playground where I could liberately explore from subject to subject, so I went to art school.
            For the past four years, it was indeed wonderful time experienting and sharing the way I think through the form of art. But months after graduation I came to realise that art isn't what I want to do <strong>full time</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Often frustrated as I face restrictions on material or space, 
    
            Developing critical thinking and creativity through the form of art was what I valued, though somehow wasn't enough. Facing restrictions on material or space was one thing, but what made me really question, was the real-life impact in what I do. I often felt 
            In search for my next step, my friend introduced me to coding. I was intriguied not because those strange symbols looked it couldn't be far from anything creative. It felt so far and unknown, I decided to give it a go. 

            As a person who craves constant challenges and likes to compete to better myself, I 
            But being a full-time artist often felt I was in a long marathon with no such intention.
            As an artist, I felt like I started a long journey whilst missing
            some of key ingridients that would wake me up in the morning and jump on to work with excitement.
            I thought: I may be a good consumer and occational creator/contributer in this field, but I cannot do this everyday as a job. <br><br>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            In search for my next step, coding came into my mind. 
            Solely because I tech industry seemed - at that time - exactly on the other side of the world. It felt so far and unknown, I was drawn. After a few weeks of watching a couple of 'crash courses' on Youtube, googling, and enrolling Udemy course, I knew there will be no going back. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>
                “You might not think that programmers are artists,
                but programming is an extremely creative profession.
                It's logic-based creativity.” - John Romero
            </span>
            
            Technology makes tools; art makes meaning. Technology is human creativity directed towards usefulness, whereas art is human creativity directed towards goodness, beauty and truth. Unfortunately a lot of jobs are heavily specialised in one direction or another, when actually the two sides are often highly complementary.
            art almost always relies on technology for its production and reproduction. 
            
            
            Software developing give answers to a lot of things I wasn't satisfied with in art.
            What both areas have in common though is creativity. I also need a lot of creativity at my job which looks very technical in the beginning – to solve problems, break up old structures and create new solutions. Here my art-influenced creative decision-making process and ability to see things from different angles certainly help while producing real-life helping products and
            
            In addition to that it is also the difference between the two worlds – art and technology – that keeps me going. I don’t think that a one-sided life is very exciting, it always is the balance between two opposites that makes our existence interesting.
            Both require brainstorming, imagination, research, experimentation, risk, and discovery to attain their goals. Both require time, skill and patience to achieve worthwhile results.
            
            In displine you become more and more free.
            
            I love the fact that you need to constantly learn, and there will be always something new you don't know about yet. It's not like, grab what you need and get a job, job done. stay the job doing the exact same thing.<br>
            Yes you need to make steady effots day by day in order to achieve something great, 
            Yes it's creative,  creativity and intuicivity
            No you do not get affected by or have restriction in material, space or money.
            Being artist is finding and forming your own way 
            I just couldn't stop coding - 10 to 14 hours a day without feeling I'm working or studing is something I never felt before.
            It's almost like there is this addictive game and every skillset is alreay given. You just need to pick them up 
            in order to enjoy better and better quality of that game. & being creative in that process is a bonus As I was getting addicted with coding, but surprisingly, the more I study and get deep into tech, i see more common grounds than the opposite.<br>
            Breaking down problems one by one, and coming up with an idea or solution from the back of my mind, and even after you solved it, knowing that there might be something more, something I don't know of yet,<strong>is thrilling and empowering.</strong><br>
            
            In short, I would still love to be an occational contributer in art field, whilst in my job, doing something I absolutely love that wakes me up every morning with excitement. And that's programming.  
            
            I'm used to get stuck. I'm also very used to try finding ways to get out of the mud, 
            collect what I should collect, and move forward.
            
            I'm particulary passionate about mental health issues,feminism, and social goods. 
            
            I’ve always been an inquisitive person, and the CodeFirst:Girls course I took last year fuelled my curiosity in programming.<br>
            receiving criticisms gives a crack in my work and let me able to see from completly different perspectives and develop from it is my fav thing. 
            creativity
            critical thinking 
            problem solving 
            my inquisitive nature 
            From what I have experienced, the tech community has been welcoming, friendly, and full of people eager to learn and help others learn too. I hope to contribute to this community as a student and teacher in years to come!
            Art has always been my main passion and has turned into a career, but I have always enjoyed tinkering with computers. I built my own PC for video editing and gaming, and over the last year started experimenting with Linux and took a couple of computer security short courses on udemy. Working on the prerequisites I've really enjoyed Codewars for its logic challenges, and I'm hoping to branch out into other languages like Python and php in the future. Hopefully as I get better at coding in general my scope for messing around with computers will improve too!<br>
            Create diverse teams. The greater the diversity, the more ideas people will be able to bring to the table. Mix Java programmers with .Net programmers; seasoned pros with a fresh grad; web developers with main framers.

                Learn to test
                Learn new technologies
                Mentor the next cohort
                From my art school years, I know so well how diversity/collaborative environment affects people's creativity 
                
                I am very keen to experience the pear-to-pear model and be a part of it. 
                WORK IN GROUPS. PEER & PAIR PROGRAMMING.
                I found out about FAC through a Medium article 4 months ago. As I was meaning to take my interest in coding 
                it's very similar to art institution. and that is the environment where I feel most comfortable to be able to perform my best. 
                I am ready to take my self-taught coding to next level. I thrive in a experienced focused person.   
                I began to look for ways to break into the field.
                I mentioned earlier that art school was my playground. I see FAC as this playground where people can be comfortable enough to be their true selves, be creative, and act.
                surrounded by people who share similar values and work towards similar goals, eager to learn 
                
                From attending the Monday meet-ups I’ve learnt something of the ethos and the supportive peer-led learning environment of Founders and Coders.
                Working on the pre-requisites for this application has really focused my efforts in learning the basics and I think I’d enjoy and hugely benefit from taking part in the full-time course, getting up to speed and then offering something back to the next cohort.

            <p class="flex-content"> 
                <span class="subheading-whyfac">Because soft skills are as important as writing good code.</span>
                Whether in promoting for bootcamps or in how-to/know-how advices, becoming a developer is often potrayed as <em>'grab a skill set in X amount of time and you'll be all set'</em> kind of thing. But the more I listen to developers and look into the nature of this industry, I realise that it's soft skills that makes a developer thrive in a long term.
                You might be able to teach yourself some programming language, but improving your adaptability, empathy, as well as the ability to navigate sticky situations whilst working with others is something you get to grasp once you are in a professional setting. So I feel FAC's intensive course that emphasises on cooperation will highly benefit beginners like myself in becoming a valuable developer, rather than (becoming) just a person who writes code as they are told.

                I generally love sharing my knowledge and experience with other people. 
                When I learn something, I constantly find myself asking, “Ok, how would I explain this to someone? What side questions would there be, and how would I push her/him more?" And that attitude teaches me a lot in return.
                
                I'm excited to take this(my attitude, teaching) further and contribute in shaping the community. it would be a previlage. 
                I'm often in awe of how supportive coding community is. FAC's peer-to-peer learning sparked pure excitement.
                Besides my love for teaching, I am also passionate about  generally love sharing my knowledge and experience with other people. 


                I am ready to be a contributer, how our society is being shaped and evolve with techbology. I hope that I get to start my journey with FAC.
                Thank you for taking time to read my story.
                I want to be a contributer opening doors to others, espacially to other women, just like I was offered to. It would be a privilage to join the FAC family as I was there along my journey. Thank you ever so much for reading this far.

                        Be an idealist when imagining a work and be a realist when making it.<br>
                        The work does not have to be huge and visually attractive.<br>
                        The work can be small and unformed.<br>
                        Remember to balance between the idea and the materiality even though the very point varies every time.
