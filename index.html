                <li>I am a sculptor, occasional writer, and a crazy dog person.</li>
                <li>I enjoy exploring and connecting with nature, learning about businesses, and tinkering with anything tech.</li>
                <li>I  have a list of things I care about, but I am particularly passionate about mental health issues and feminism.</li>
                <li>My hidden talent is that I can sell just about anything to anyone. (well, most of the times!)</li>
                <li>When I was younger, my dream was to live in London; simply because my favourite Disney film is 101 Dalmatians and the story took place here. I am still very much in love with the city.</li>

            <h3 class="title">So why coding?</h3>
            <p>
                I have always known for my inquisitiveness - always onto something, observing, experimenting (and causing troubles at times). Fine art seemed to be a liberating playground where I could explore from subject to subject, so I went to art school. 
                For the past four years, it was indeed valuable time exploring and sharing the way I think through the form of art. But after graduation I slowly came to realise that art isn't what I want to do <strong>full time</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Often frustrated by the limitation of material, space, and/or social impact in what I do, I wanted to try something new outside the field. Coding came close to my mind not because I was familiar with the industry, but because it felt so far and unknown, I was intrigued to give it a go. It started by watching a few crash courses on Youtube whilst thinking; this wouldn't go further than this, surely. But soon later, I was spending 12+ hours a day taking courses on Udemy and doing toy projects myself. Doing projects when I barely understood JavaScript meant that I was in constant need of advice from others, so I joined a number of coding communites where I met so many great people who were eager to help. Both online and at meetups. The level of commitment and passion it formed was something I've never had before, and it continued to grow weeks after weeks. By the time I've attended a hackathon - which I loved every minuite of - I knew I wasn't going back.

                <p class="manifesto">- A segment of the manifesto I wrote during my final year at uni. It is something I come back to when I am mentally challenged in coding and it helps in one way or another. </p>
                
                <p>
                    Coding is a funny thing. While it requires you to flex your creative muscles and critical thinking just like art does, you also need to follow the hard rules and mathematical logics. <strong>But the more logics and rules you got in your hand, you become more free and capable in terms of how further you can go with your imagination</strong>. It's very much like a game with a controller. Except that there is no 'final level' or 'game over'. As long as you keep learning, you are endlessly evolving. (and you might hack that game, too.)
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Another motivation and excitement comes from the cycle of coding - <strong>plan, solve, test and refine</strong>. I didn't realise I'd enjoy problem solving process and a bit of mathematics, but I really do! I love to approach problems from different angles, break them down into digestible chunks, and then work towards elegant and easy-to-understand solutions. By repeating those steps, I learned to be comfortable being uncomfortable in the midst of challenges, and keep trying until it leads to a clearer solution. I would love to continue learning in this challenging, yet rewarding setting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To me, discovering the world of programming felt as if I was able to go underwater for the first time and realise that actually, I've only hit the tip of the iceberg in terms of what I can do with my abilities. And that there's the whole rest of it I didn't know existed. I am now eager to take a step further from here; become an aspiring developer, explore the field in depth, and essentially make my contribution in how society is being shaped with technology. Hopefully, my journey begins with Founders and Coders.

        <div class="grid-whyfac">
            
            <div class="grid-img">
                <img class="svg-whyfac" src="imgs/reason1.svg" alt="reasons-for-aplying">

                <p> 
                    <span class="subheading-whyfac">I believe in the culture FAC stands for.</span> 
                    I was impressed by the fact that FAC is creating a place where everyone feels safe and supportive regardless of their race, gender and identity. Coming from creative background, I know that one's performance overall is well connected with how the place makes her/him feel. I witnesse many occasions where the fear of being judged knocks people down and distract them from reaching their full potential. Feeling at ease with where you are and the people around you matters because not only does it lead us to perform our best and bring more ideas to the table, but <strong>most importantly, it creates a safe place to fail</strong>. It is refreshing to see how FAC values what it takes for people to really grow - such a rare thing to find in coding bootcamps. Learning new skills can be intimidating at times, and I would love to join and learn with like-minded people in an institution that shares the same beliefs in education. That's a win-win.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    <span class="subheading-whyfac">Because soft skills are as important as writing good code.</span>
                    Whether in promoting bootcamps or in how-to/know-how advices, becoming a developer is often potrayed as <em>'grab a skill set in X amount of time and you'll be all set'</em> kind of thing. But the more I listen to developers and look into the nature of this industry, <strong>I realise that it's the soft skills that makes a developer thrive in a long term.</strong>
                    You might teach yourself some programming languages on your own, but improving your adaptability, empathy, as well as the ability to navigate sticky situations whilst working with others is something you get to grasp once you are in a professional setting. I believe FAC's intensive programme that emphasises on cooperation will highly benefit beginners like myself in becoming a valuable developer, rather than a person who can only write code as they are told. 
                </p>

            <div class="grid-img">

                    <span class="subheading-whyfac">I want to give back.</span> 
                    I have been meaning to put my logic-based creativity into worthwhile projects for some time now, and I am excited for the second part of the programme; Tech for Better. It sounds exactly the kind of project I want to take part in. Being able to work with organisations that share similar visions as mine, and help them making an impact in our society is actually one of the reasons why I chose to be in this industry, and it's something I plan to do throughout my career. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, and ultimately, <strong>I want to be a developer who opens doors of possibilites for others. Especially for other women and minorities, just like I have been offered along the way</strong>. I began teaching myself to code 4 months ago and looking back on this short journey, I have nothing but sheer gratitude for the people that inspired me to keep trying and dream big. Knowing what Founders and Coders' core values are, it would be a privilage to be an invested member of FAC family and inspire others in the same way that people have inspired me so far.<br><br>
                    Thank you.
